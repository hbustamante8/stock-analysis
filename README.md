# stock-analysis


## Overview of Project
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to refactor code that was used analyze stock market data in 2017 and 2018 and see the reults as well as differences between the two different scripts. There are 12 different stocks within the data source which have data from 2017 and 2018. With a click of the button "Run Analysis for All Stocks" , within the "All Stocks Analysis" sheet, a total daily volume and return are calculated based on the year chosen (2017/2018). 

## Results

### Comparing the stocks performances between 2017 and 2018
Below are the outputsfor 2017 and 2018 after pressing the "Run Analysis for All Stocks" button and choosing desired year.

### Execution times between original and refactored script

The execution time for the refactored macro code ran faster than the original macro code. On average the execution for the orginal code took 0.30 seconds to run the macro for both 2017 and 2018. The refactored macro took about .08 second on average to run the macro for both years.
